# 7.1-Nested-For-Loops

## Rolling Dice
Write a rolling_dice() function that will print out all combinations that can be made when 2 dice are rolled.

Your output should look like this:
```
1 : 1
1 : 2
1 : 3
1 : 4
1 : 5
1 : 6
2 : 1
2 : 2
2 : 3
2 : 4
2 : 5
2 : 6

...
6 : 1
6 : 2
6 : 3
6 : 4
6 : 5
6 : 6
```
And should continue until all values up to 6,6 are printed.

Because you know exactly how many times each loop should iterate, you should use nested for loops to complete this program.

## Categories

Write a categories() function that asks the user for three categories. For each category, ask the user for three things in that category. You should print something for each category that states the category and the three things in that category.

Here is what running your final program should look like:

```
Enter a category: animals
Enter an example of animals: cheetah
Enter an example of animals: pelican
Enter an example of animals: horse
animals: cheetah pelican horse 

Enter a category: noises
Enter an example of noises: vroom!
Enter an example of noises: whirrr!
Enter an example of noises: whooosh!
noises: vroom! whirrr! whooosh! 

Enter a category: programming languages
Enter an example of programming languages: Java
Enter an example of programming languages: Python
Enter an example of programming languages: C++
programming languages: Java Python C++ 
```
